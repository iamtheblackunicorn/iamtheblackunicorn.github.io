## Apps, packages, and Python

I started my journey as a software developer in Python roughly eight years ago. Since then I have taught myself 5 programming languages. I taught myself the Dart programming language only recently and write most of my code in Dart. I do not only develop apps in Dart using the Flutter framework but also write packages for [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/blckunicorn.art/packages), the Dart package index. I have written eight packages in Dart as of now and use some of these in the apps that you can find below!
